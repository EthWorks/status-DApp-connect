## How to run the project

1. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    # npm
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    # gulp
    gulp
    ```

    Now you should be able to see the project running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. Open `./index.html` in your editor (VS Code recommended) and start editing!

## For production

```bash
# gulp
gulp build

```
